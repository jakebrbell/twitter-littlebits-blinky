# LittleBits, Blink LED When Somebody Tweets [...]

By Tomomi Imura ([@girlie_mac][twitter])

A simple demo with LittleBits in node.js using Johnny-Five, which notifies you when somebody tweeted with certain queries by blinking LED.

### What is LittleBits?

[LittleBits][littlebits] is a open source library of electric modules that you can snap together with magnets. There are over 60 Lego-like modules and more than 150,000 possible circuit combinations to play with.

### Communicate LittleBits with Arduino using Node.js

I am using [Johnny-Five][j5], an Open Source, Firmata Protocol based, IoT and Robotics programming framework for Node.js, developred by Rick Waldron.

Anna Gerber gathered all information and sample code to get started with [programming LittleBits with Jonny-Five][anna].

### PubNub Twitter Firehose

This demo uses [PubNub Twitter data stream][firehose].


## Assembling LittleBits
